# fitbit_analyses

This repository contains analyses using fitbit data that focus on heart rate and sleep. One [notebook](https://github.com/andymartens/fitbit_analyses/blob/master/Get%20Fitbit%20data%20from%20API.ipynb) provides instructions for getting data from the fitbit API. A second notebook begins to examine heart rate during sleep and how it relates to subjective ratings of sleep quality.
